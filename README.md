ABSTRACT

These days the major problem which is common between the students is
the lack of proper career guidance. The students have difficulty in
choosing their streams. Hence,  here our team comes with an efficient
solution through which the student will be able to choose the desired
stream as per their potential.Our team is working on the problem
statement  stating to develop a portal for education institutions
where the student can upload their details and will get relevant
opportunities. Our approach to this problem is to create a web portal
where a student can upload his details in the csv format and all the
details will be scanned and stored in the database ,on the basis of
the details one can get the relevant opportunities as per the place a
user has opted for. We will also make a search engine that will help
in fetching millions of records at a time. Our interface will be very
simple which will reduce the users effort .
